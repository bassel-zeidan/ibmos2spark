# ibmos2spark

The package sets Spark Hadoop configurations for connecting to 
IBM Bluemix Object Storage and Softlayer Account Object Storage instances
with the swift protocol. This packages uses the new [swift2d/stocator](https://github.com/SparkTC/stocator) protocol, availble
on the latest IBM Spark Service instances (and through IBM Data Science Experience). 


## Build

This builds jar files for both Spark 1.6.0 (Scala 2.10.4) and Spark 2.0.2 (Scala 2.11.8)

```
sbt +assembly
```

## Installation

We are in the process of publishing these `jar` files to a Maven repo. For now, the `%AddJar` magic funtion within 
a Scala notebook will install the package.

### Spark 1.6.0 (Scala 2.10)

```scala
%AddJar https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/ibmos2spark/raw/master/scala/jars/scala-2.10/ibmos2spark-assembly-0.0.7dev.jar -f 
```


### Spark 2.0.2 (Scala 2.11)

```scala
%AddJar https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/ibmos2spark/raw/master/scala/jars/scala-2.11/ibmos2spark-assembly-0.0.7dev.jar -f
```


## Usage

### Bluemix


```scala
import com.ibm.ibmos2spark.bluemix

// The credentials HashMap may be created for you with the 
// "insert to code" link in your DSX notebook. 

var credentials = scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[String, String](
  "auth_url"->"https://identity.open.softlayer.com",
  "project_id"->"xx",
  "region"->"xx",
  "user_id"->"xx",
  "password"->"xx",
)

var container = "mycontainer"
var objectname = "mydata"
var configurationname = "bluemix_object_storage_connection"

var bmos = new bluemix(sc, configurationname, credentials)
var rdd = sc.textFile(bmos.url(container , objectname))

```


### Softlayer



```scala
import com.ibm.ibmos2spark.softlayer

var authurl = "xx"
var tenant = "xx"
var user = "xx"
var password = "xx"

var container = "mycontainer"
var objectname = "mydata"
var configurationname = "softlayerOSconnection"

var slos = new softlayer(sc, configurationname, authurl, tenant, user, password)
var rdd = sc.textFile(slos.url(container , objectname))

```

### Package Info

One can use the automatically generated object, `BuildInfo`, to obtain the package version
and other information. This object is automatically generated by the 
[`sbt-buildinfo`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-buildinfo) plugin.

```
import com.ibm.ibmos2spark.BuildInfo

var buildstring = BuildInfo.toString
var buildbmap = BuildInfo.toMap
var buildjson = BuildInfo.toJson
